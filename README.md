# Reduce it ;)

There are several things we can do with only Array.prototype.reduce

### History

On one of SÃ£o Paulo's hottest nights, three developers gather in a bar to satisfy their thirst and to talk about Javascript.

-- You know that there are several things we can do with only `Array.prototype.reduce`, for example every kind of collection manipulation. -- Sugested developer01.

-- Your talking about the programming style that uses only functions aren't you? That can't be true, in some place you'll have to use the other language keywords -- Argued developer02.

-- Well, that actually might make sense... I'll give a try, and start a project to do the _all kinds of collection manipulations_. -- I said.

-- Your are wasting your time! -- Challenged developer02.
